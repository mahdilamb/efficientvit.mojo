# EfficientViT.mojo

Incomplete conversion of EfficientViT into mojo. (WIP - mostly just to get my head around the language).

## Roadmap

- [x] Export torch weights into binary
- [x] Read exported weights
- [x] Design script that runs inference with just weights
- [ ] Convert script into functions that call torch
- [ ] Convert torch functions to native mojo
